[![PHP Annotated Monthly](https:/blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/phpstorm-PHP_Annotated_blog_1600x800.png)](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2022/05/php-annotated--2022-spring-catch-up/)

  

Greetings everyone,

  

It has been a while since the PHP Annotated Monthly was online, so hopefully we are back on track. With [Brent](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) joining the PhpStorm team we want to experiment with some new things, so stay tuned!

  

In this edition, we‚Äôll catch up on the most interesting things that have happened in the PHP world over the last couple of months. As always, it includes curated news, articles, tools, and videos.

News

*   **[PHP 7.4.29](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.4.29), [PHP 8.1.5](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.1.5), and [PHP 8.0.18](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.0.18)**  
      
    These are security releases for Windows users, due to updates of built-in dependencies. For non-Windows users, they are just regular bug-fix updates.For PHP 7.3, updates [are no longer released](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php), even for security problems. If you are still using PHP 7.3 or PHP 5.x versions, consider updating as soon as possible.
    
      
    
    The Symfony team has [raised](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/45377) its minimum required PHP version to 8.1 in the upcoming Symfony 6.1 release. The same shift was made for [Drupal 10](https://www.drupal.org/node/3264830) and [Laravel 10](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/41250).
    
      
    
    Also, the recently released [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-22-04-features-and-release-date) comes with PHP 8.1 preinstalled.
    
  
*   **Updates from [the PHP Foundation](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation)**  
    
      
    *   [Six sponsored developers](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/updates/the-php-foundation-update-march-2022) are actively working on maintaining the core.
      
    *   The [thephp.foundation](https://thephp.foundation/) website is up and running.
      
    *   A separate newsletter with insights about core developments will be published regularly. Here‚Äôs the first edition: [PHP Roundup #1](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/).
      
    *   [Interview with Core Developers](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/06/interview-with-core-developers/) by Sebastian Bergmann.
      
    
      
    
  
*   **[Developer Ecosystem Survey 2022](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/t-developer-ecosystem-survey-2022)**  
      
    The annual survey from JetBrains is now open and, of course, there is a section about PHP. This is what the [results from last year](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/php/) look like. Take the survey for a chance to win one of the prizes!
  
*   **News from PHP-FIG**  
    
      
    *   [Coding Style PER (PHP Evolving Recommendation)](https://github.com/php-fig/per-coding-style) has been officially approved by PHP-FIG and will replace PSR-12. This is the first [PER](https://www.php-fig.org/bylaws/per-workflow/) document showing the ‚Äúlive‚Äù standard. Thanks to PERs, there will be no need to release another PSR standard every time new syntax is added to PHP. Instead, PERs will be updated according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/lang/ru/).
      
    *   A new PSR draft has been approved: [PSR-22 ‚Äì Application Tracing](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/tracing.md).
      
    
      
    
  
*   **[PhpStorm 2022.1 released](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2022/04/phpstorm-2022-1-release/)**  
      
    It comes with improvements for Blade, WordPress, ArrayShape annotations, and many more. Check out a short [What‚Äôs New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqck6bJ1JWo) video or read the [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2022/04/phpstorm-2022-1-release/) for the full story.
  
*   **[Composer 2.3 Release](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-3/)**  
      
    This release brings small improvements for users and a modernized internal codebase.
    
      
    
    There was also a vulnerability discovered recently ‚Äì [CVE-2022-24828: Composer Command Injection](https://blog.packagist.com/cve-2022-24828-composer-command-injection-vulnerability/). An attacker controlling a Git or Mercurial repository explicitly listed by URL in `composer.json` could use specially crafted branch names to execute commands on the machine running the composer update.
    
      
    
    Make sure your Composer is up-to-date by running `composer self-update`.
    
  
*   **[Craft CMS 4](https://craftcms.com/blog/craft-4?ref=phpannotated)**  
      
    A major update of the popular [open-source](https://github.com/craftcms/cms) CMS was released.
  

  

PHP Core
--------

  

Most of the Core news is covered in detail in the [PHP Roundup series](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/) from the PHP Foundation, so we‚Äôll only mention them briefly.

  

  
*   [**Last call for PHP 8.2 release managers!**](https://externals.io/message/117595#117664)  
      
    You need to be able to commit to a 3¬Ω-year term, and have good knowledge of PHP, Git, and preferably C. There are [already](https://wiki.php.net/todo/php82#volunteers) one veteran and six rookie candidates.
  
*   ‚úÖ [\[RFC\] Redacting parameters in back traces](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/redact_parameters_in_back_traces) #PHP8.2
  
*   ‚úÖ [\[RFC\] Allow null and false as stand-alone types](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types) #PHP8.2
  
*   ‚úÖ [\[RFC\] Deprecate ${} string interpolation](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_dollar_brace_string_interpolation) #PHP8.2
  
*   ‚úÖ [\[RFC\] Deprecate and Remove utf8\_encode and utf8\_decode](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_utf8_decode_and_utf8_encode)
  
*   ‚úÖ [\[RFC\] Undefined Variable Error Promotion](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/undefined_variable_error_promotion)
  
*   üó≥ [\[RFC\] Readonly classes](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_classes)
  
*   ‚ùå [\[RFC\] Sealed Classes](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/sealed_classes)
  
*   üÜï [\[RFC\] Add true type](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/true-type)
  
*   üÜï [\[RFC\] Disjunctive Normal Form Types](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dnf_types)
  
*   [\[RFC\] final class CollectionsDeque](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deque)  
      
    As part of an initiative to add optimized data structures to PHP, the first proposal is ready.  
      
    `Deque` ‚Äì This is a two-way queue, i.e. items can be added and removed both at the beginning and at the end. It can be used instead of `SplQueue` or `SplDoublyLinkedList` to get a performance gain and reduce memory consumption.
  
*   [RFC Introduce a class-string type](https://gist.github.com/cspray/0f4e67e8731a8ea9382147707e75287f)  
      
    It‚Äôs not an official RFC, but an interesting idea to make class-string a real type, as it‚Äôs already widely used in static analyzers‚Äô annotations.

**Generics**
------------

  

PHP has seen a lot of generics-related activity lately, so we gave them their own section in this post.

  

  
*   üì∫ First, check out this series of videos on [Generics in PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8hQ1fWU_mQ&list=PL0bgkxUS9EaKyOugEDffRzsvupBE2YEoD) from Brent.
  
*   If you‚Äôd like to dive deeper, you might be interested in the post about [Generics implementation approaches](https://dev.to/mrsuh/generics-implementation-approaches-3bf0).
  
*   Try an interesting project that implements them in PHP: [mrsuh/php-generics](https://github.com/mrsuh/php-generics). Interestingly, there was a [discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/ta5d4u/php_perfomance_mode_yay_or_nay/) about dropping the runtime type checks in PHP for performance. The tool above [implements type erasure](https://github.com/mrsuh/php-generics#type-erasure), so it could theoretically be used for such performance use cases: `composer dump-generics --type=type-erasure`.
  
*   One of the main applications of generics is collections. Check out [Comparing PHP Collections](https://dev.to/mrsuh/comparing-php-collections-5cca).
  
*   And last but not least, fun art by [@SerafimArts](https://github.com/SerafimArts): ![](https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/generics.gif)
